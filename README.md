# Flat Earth
Our objective is to prove that the earth is flat by providing a way for people to find places on the true flat map of earth.<br>
They can also write reviews about the flatness of the place and upload flat images of the places for others to see later.
--------------------
Note : Image upload does not work.

This web app was made with the help from ChatGPT.
It did most of the carrying in this project but at least I learnt a few things in the process.
